# [Capital Trivia]([https://pdm-prep.netlify.app/](https://capital-trivia.netlify.app/))

A web app designed to simulate drivers exams in the state of Pennsylvania, helping people to better prepare for their license.

Questions are stored in a json file and randomly generated for the user, while keeping track of correct and incorrect answers.

Shorthands are also added to give the user better expirence while answering question, instead of relying on mouse movement too much.


# Tech stack

Tech used: HTML, CSS & JS, MongoDB for future user score tracking implementation

# Optimizations

While the project is considered finished and completely functional, media queries will be implemented to help people play the game on the go!

In addition, another thing that will be added in the near future is score tracking and having a leaderboards table so that you can share your knowledge with fellow players

This will be an optional feature and MongoDb will be used to keep track of player results, and their peak scores
